    <main>
        <p>Building good credit involves several key practices. Firstly, it's important to pay bills on time and in full each month, as payment history is a major factor in determining credit scores. Additionally, maintaining a low credit utilization ratio, which is the amount of credit you're using compared to your total available credit, can positively impact your credit score. Another strategy is to keep older accounts open, as the length of your credit history also influences your creditworthiness. Lastly, regularly checking your credit report for errors and addressing any inaccuracies promptly can help ensure that your credit profile remains accurate and favorable.</p>
